This folder contains information about what mosquitto setting is required for the project.

The host server should also utilize ngrok to avoid complication in setting up a DNS. 
The mqtt data sent can use hapemo.github.io.

If you use test_web.html included in this same folder, you won't require the setting up of ngrok nor DNS for TLS support, http would be sufficient.
